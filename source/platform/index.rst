Platforms
=========

Adventure integrates with many of the Minecraft platforms out there. Some platforms support
Adventure natively, but other platforms have their own types and need an adapter to handle Adventure types. To enable you to use Adventure with these platforms, Adventure provides a number of platform-specific adapters to
allow you to obtain ``Audience`` instances from native user types.
