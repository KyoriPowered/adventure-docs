Community Libraries
===================

Adventure aims to provide the core libraries needed for interacting with chat components. However, with 
our limited time and the sheer number of possible use cases, we can't hope to provide direct solutions for every problem. 

Luckily, many of our community members have produced libraries that complement Adventure, providing additional features and integrations with other software.

.. note::
    This list of libraries is provided for reference only. The Kyori team does not endorse any specific ones, and cannot provide any information beyond the provided links.

    If you have a library that you'd like included, please open a pull request on the `adventure-docs <https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure-docs/>`_ repository.
