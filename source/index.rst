   .. warning:: This documentation is for an **unreleased** version of 
      Adventure. Some information may not be up to date, and API is subject to change.

Adventure is a library for server-controllable user interface elements in *Minecraft: Java Edition*.

Most users will want to use Adventure as a component of an existing modding platform. The best-integrated are our :ref:`native-support`, but we also support other platforms via adaptors.

To get started using Adventure on its own, see :doc:`getting-started`.

There are many community-supported libraries that extend the capabilities of Adventure and provide integrations with other software. To see a list of those we've heard of, see :doc:`/community-libraries`.
